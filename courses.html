                    Java is a
                    high-level,
                    class-based,
                    object-oriented
                    programming language
                    that is
                    designed to have as
                    few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
                    to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                    all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are
                    typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the
                    underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer
                    low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as
                    reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled
                    languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
                    GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million
                    developers.[21]

                    Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by
                    Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original
                    and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally
                    released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of
                    the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only
                    license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference
                    implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and
                    is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.</p>

                    Machine
                    learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience
                    and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning
                    algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions
                    or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used
                    in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and
                    computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform
                    the needed tasks.[3]

                    A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making
                    predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of
                    mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine
                    learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through
                    unsupervised learning.[5][6] Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks
                    in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain.[7][8] In its application across business
                    problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.</p>

                    The Internet
                    of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) that are embedded with
                    sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with
                    other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.[1][2][3][4]

                    The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous
                    computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning.[1]
                    Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation
                    (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of
                    things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the
                    concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures,
                    thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more
                    common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as

                    The Internet
                    of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) that are embedded with
                    sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with
                    other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.[1][2][3][4]

                    The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous
                    computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning.[1]
                    Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation
                    (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of
                    things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the
                    concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures,
                    thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more
                    common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as
                    smartphones and smart speakers. The IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.[5]
