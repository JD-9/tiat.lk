                TIAT Academy
                is a coding
                school
                with expertized software architects, coding enthusiasts, and software engineers in Sri Lanka. Our
                mission is to: "teach you what exactly is software engineering and how you can do it the
                professional way for a successful coding journey".</p>

                class="mb-6 px-5 md:px-20 md:text-lg lg:text-2xl text-white text-center md:text-left font-semibold paragraph-text-shadow">
                The
                students are
                free to
                choose
                their own path by being able to choose what exactly they want to learn for their purposes. Whether
                you want to become a web developer, a desktop applications developer, an IoT developer, a mobile app
                developer or, a data analyst, we've got you covered. At TIAT, it's always about innovation, quality,
                and professionalism. Software engineering is a moderate job, so we teach our students by using
                professional coding methods, to get the student up to speed. The result is a very good logical
                thinker, and an innovative engineer.</p>

                You
                don't need any previous coding knowledge to learn here. We've got you covered, we teach you starting
                the basics to building complex algorithms. Although, you'll need a good computer literacy to learn
                how to code. So, if you don't have a good computer literacy, start from our CS course before
                touching any software engineering courses.</p>

                Our courses are designed with the average human beign in mind. So, you understand everything we
                teach you. We make sure you don't forget any important syntax by using memory techniques. We teach
                you the most important things about software engineering: colloboration with other engineers,
                architects, and designers on projects, the standards of technologies and programming languages, how
                to
                stay within those standards, how you should think like a programmer, and much more. Making sure you
                won't become another programmer who always looks at a blinking cursor with a degree. The paper
                doesn't matter much to a real engineer, but the skills do. Our approach to building your skills is
                quite different from traditional institues of Sri Lanka. All of our courses are online courses, so
                you don't have to leave your desk. Our courses are designed to adapt to everyone. You'll see why and
                how we are different from other institutions once you join.</p>

                    your computer and we'll
                    teach you everything you need to know about software engineering. Everything in software
                    engineering requires a computer, so you don't have to write code the boring/old (on boards,
                    books, etc...) way while learning. We make sure that you learn everything by the end of each
                    course. Otherwise, we'll teach you again, until coding becomes second nature to you.</p>

                    can show others by doing things and on paper too. We'll make sure that coding becomes second

                    browsing <a class="link-text" href="courses.html">Courses</a> page. We're not
                    some old guys telling

                    what to
                    follow. Learn by doing, and understanding programming rather than days of
                    programming lectures and writing code on paper. We believe that the lecture hall is not the best
                    place to learn how to code. That's why you're not required to leave your comfort zone if you

                        mine suggested TIAT Academy. Initially, I started with Java and Android Studio. Now, I am a
                        freelance mobile app developer who earns more than $4000 a month. Later, I followed
                        Dart/Flutter and Swift/Xcode courses. Now, I develop mobile apps for Android, and iOS. The
                        experiences I've got from TIAT helped me to move up faster. If you're thinking about beign a
                        mobile app developer, this is where you should begin. TIAT Academy's courses are worthy of
                        your investments.</blockquote>

                        and what can I say? Now, here I am working for a company as a frontend developer. If you're

                        lectures. Not to mention that you won't need to watch the online lectures again and again,
                        because the way they teach is so natural and most of my fellow students have understood the

                        While it may be difficult to believe that children can learn the intricacies of coding, it's
                        important to remember that computer programming is its own language — and children are
                        experts at absorbing new languages due to their brain plasticity, rapid neural linking
                        abilities, and limited inhibitions.

                        But, as a teacher or parent who might not be familiar with coding, how do you begin teaching
                        the fundamentals of computer programming? And, what programming language should you focus

                        choosing a programming language for your project.

                        We will focus on the backend, as the choice of coding language for the frontend is usually
                        more limited. Most of the advice is equally valid for backend and frontend, though,
                        especially when it comes to the biases we may have.

                        Launching a technical project starts with a lot of non-technical considerations. Depending
                        on your level of experience in the field, this might appear counterintuitive, but don't
                        forget that a technical artifact is always created to answer a non-technical need that
                        defines its characteristics.

                        These are the main things you'll consider when choosing a programming language. <br><a href="#"

                        That
                        depends on the role
                        you've applied for! Software engineering jobs tend to fall under two categories:
                        domain-specific or general programming.

                        If you're interviewing for a domain-specific role, expect the questions to center around the
                        specific technology you specialize in, such as AWS or cloud infrastructure, or IoT. These
                        highly-technical interviews will be very focused on the technology in question.

                        For a general programming or web development role, the process is fundamentally different.
                        These interviews evaluate your problem-solving ability as well as your coding proficiency,
                        so recruiters are likely to ask questions ranging from the technical to the behavioral. It's
                        this general sort of role that we're focusing on for this article. <br><a href="#"

                    before. In effective: <span class="alt-text-color-3 italic">7th of February.</span> We've informed
                    you about this matter around a month ago. This means that
                    if your class's usual starting time is 7:00 AM,
                    it'll be started at an <span class="alt-text-color-3 italic">hour earlier</span> at 6:00 AM starting
                    from
                    7th of February. This is due to the
                    COVID-19 outbreak. Also, you have to expect some more time changes in the future. We'll inform
                    all the students as if necessary.</p>
